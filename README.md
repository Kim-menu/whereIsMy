# where_is_my

People usually forget where they did put their stuffs at home.

I want to help them by using awesome app "whereIsMy".

## How

1. When you put stuffs anywhere, input data(place-item pair) in app.
2. Later, if you forget where you did put stuff, input item's name in app.
3. Then you can find it easily.
